                  Like most engineering students, I started coding in my first year. It was boring, uninteresting and I couldn't make something tangible with my skills. Printing some patterns on the screen didn't take me anywhere.   Although I did well in that subject, the dullness with which it was taught and my own lack of information really slipped the priority of coding to the bottom. 
                </p><p class="text-white">    
                  I cleared another programming subject, but this time I took it upon myself as a challenge to truly understand it. Dealing with technology on a daily basis and this "chatter" about AI piqued my interest. So I started learning, exploring as many things I could. In short, I did a couple of online courses, read some books, attended a few webinars and built several personal projects to reach my current level, where I enjoy coding and also have a decent job offer in my kitty. In this post, I will try to tell you what I did to kickstart my journey. I hope it kickstarts yours.
              </p><p class="text-white">
                  Major sources of my learning have been articles, tutorials and how-to spread across the internet. I did several courses on Edx and Courseera. I found that once the fundamentals are built, through online courses and books, navigating through the internet makes it much easier to apply it on real problems. It's the initial kickstart that's hard, once we get in the flow of learning and understanding, it gets much easier and enjoyable. For learning to code, I recommend Hackerrank, Leetcode, Codechef or any such platform. You can begin with Hackerrank, which has a lot of bite-sized coding challenges based on the topic and level of difficulty. It really reinforces the concepts until you truly understand what you've actually written. Leetcode and Codechef are also good, especially for competitive programming. This comes at a later stage when we're comfortable with our skills.
              </p><p class="text-white">    
                  For online courses(a big list of which you can find on my LinkedIn), Edx and Courseera are great. They deeply delve into concepts and is taught by ivy-league professors. The only disadvantage they have is that they can get very theory heavy and hard to digest at times. This is where Udacity excels. The videos are broken into consumable chunks with enough information get you up and running fast. They regularly have scholarship courses, where we can get access to their prime content. I have won their Deep Learning Nanodegree, which is sponsored by Facebook. 
              </p><p class="text-white">
                  While learning anything, our mental spirit is as important as the quality of resource we are using to learn. I often found myself alone in my pursuit, a lot of effort had to be put in to understand and find the right places to learn from.  We are failed by our educational setup. We are taught to simply pass. We study to simply pass. The theory has too much focus, practical applications take the backseat first. This is where we, Code Canopy, step in. We want to give you that environment where you want to learn. Where building skills come first. Understanding comes first. Imagining comes first. And when we truly understand, we enjoy it. It ripples across our whole being. We become more happy, kind and helpful. Things start falling into place. Whether it is implementing that vague idea you had or getting that job you want or both ;)</p>
